## studentviz

Currently being improved with features such as (a) loading csv data files into the system, (b) additional visualization and distortion techniques suggested to visualize the domain explicit knowledgge published in (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Semiu_Akanmu3/publication/268741081_Students'_Data-Driven_Decision_Making_in_HEI_The_Explicit_Knowledge_Involved/links/5605e00108aea25fce341f1f/Students-Data-Driven-Decision-Making-in-HEI-The-Explicit-Knowledge-Involved.pdf).

This application started as  a prototype, and a proof of concept, for a design conceptual framework I proposed in my PhD (2016); titled "A Conceptual Design Framework for MultiDimensional Dataset in Higher Education Institutions". It was intended to be a multidimensional data visualization tool for Higher Education Institution.
Its targeted users are HEI policy makers that rely on students dataset for actionable insights and decision making. It was, however, very limited because it heavily relied on Google Visualization API (Read the documentation here: https://developers.google.com/chart/?refresh=1) and GoogleForm for data storage and query

The first version is of the prototype is temporarily hosted on: http://students.cs.ndsu.nodak.edu/~akanmu/studentviz/motionchart.html
