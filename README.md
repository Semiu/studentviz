# StudentViz: a tool for multidimensional visual analytics of higher education institutions' students' data

This is an ongoing project expected to feature:
-(a) loading csv data files into the system, 
-(b) data entry and input through form submission, 
-(c) multi-user authorization dependent environment, and 
-(d) comprehensive  implementation of the conceptual design framework proposed in [**Akanmu Semiu A.** & Zulikha, J. (2017). *A Framework for Designing Information Visualization for Higher Education Institutions’ Students’ Data*, The Landscape of Computing & Informatics Research Zulikha, J. &. Zakaria, N. H, & Mazni, O. (Eds.)), *The Landscape of Computing & Informatics Research (2016 – 2017*)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ROaTHt0AAAAJ&hl=en).

## First, but now rested, version
This application started as  a prototype, and a proof of concept, of a design framework I proposed in my [PhD (2016)](http://etd.uum.edu.my/6046/2/s95110_02.pdf)

Its targeted users are higher education institutions' (HEI) policy makers who rely on students' dataset for actionable insights and decision making. It was, however, very limited because it heavily relied on [Google Visualization API](https://developers.google.com/chart/?refresh=1) and GoogleForm for data storage and query. 

This first version is temporarily hosted [here](http://students.cs.ndsu.nodak.edu/~akanmu/studentviz/motionchart.html)
