# studentviz
This project is a prototype, and proof of concept, of a design conceptual framework I proposed in my PhD (2016). 
It is multidimensional data visualization tool for Higher Education Institution.
Its target users are HEI policy makers that rely on students dataset for actional insights and decision making.
